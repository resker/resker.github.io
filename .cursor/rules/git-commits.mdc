# Git commits

When suggesting or creating git commits:

- **Do not** add "Co-authored-by: Cursor" or any "Co-authored-by" trailer to commit messages.
- **Do not** add Cursor, AI, or agent attribution in the commit body or footer.
- Use only the commit subject (and optional body) provided or agreed with the user.

Commit messages should contain only the intended description of the change, with no co-author or tool attribution.
