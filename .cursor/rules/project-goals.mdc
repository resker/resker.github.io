# Project goals

This site exists to display:

- **A single SVG** — One scalable vector graphic (coffee cup). No other visual content.
- **Dark/light mode** — The page must adapt to the viewport/user setting for dark vs light mode (e.g. `prefers-color-scheme`).
- **Centering** — The image must be centered vertically and horizontally within the viewport.
- **Viewport-relative scaling** — The image must be a defined percentage of the viewport (e.g. 15–25%) and must scale proportionally when the window is resized (use viewport units such as `vmin` so size tracks resize).
- **Assistive text** — Descriptive text for the image must be available to assistive devices/features (e.g. `alt` on `<img>`) and must not be visible on screen.
- **Standards** — Markup and styles must follow the latest standards, validate (e.g. html-validate, stylelint), and remain viewable in current major browsers.
- **Simplicity** — All elements (HTML, CSS, and anything else) must be simple, minimalist, free of cruft, easy to read, and generally elegant.

When changing HTML or CSS, ensure these goals are still met and that centering/scaling work in real browsers (e.g. test with `<img>` for SVGs if `<object>` does not scale or center reliably).
